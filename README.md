# A Warhammer 40K NFT Implementation for education purposes

This project was created to educate myself about Ethereum, Contract and NFT.

By the end, a deeper understanding of the following topics was reached:

- The Ethereum Ecosystem.
- The Ethereum Stack.
- Smart Contract: anatomy, testing and deployment.
- Different Token Standards (Fungible and Non-Fungible).
- How to setup a development environment for creating Smart Contract.

## I. Overview

---

Hardhat was used as the main development suit.

Libraries used:

- Typescript
- Waffle, Ether.js, Chai, Mocha: for testing
- Hardhat plugins.

## II. Setup

---

**Requirement**: Node.js

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run **npm install**

Commands to try:

- **npx hardhat compile**: Compile contract.
- **npx hardhat test**: Run all test.
- **npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts**: Test contract deployment to a local Ethereum node instance.
